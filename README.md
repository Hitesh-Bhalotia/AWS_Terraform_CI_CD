<h2>Terraform AWS VPC with EC2 Instance via Github Actions</h2>

This repository contains Terraform configuration files to provision infrastructure on AWS. The infrastructure includes a VPC, a subnet within that VPC, and an EC2 instance within the subnet. A security group is also created to manage network traffic, allowing SSH inbound access and all outbound traffic. Additionally, this repository leverages GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to validate, plan, apply, and destroy the Terraform configurations.
